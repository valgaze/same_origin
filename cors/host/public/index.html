  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
  <hr />
  <p>
     This is a CORS Demonstration. We are making a request to http://localhost:3000/req/1 and our page is hosted on http://localhost:3001/, this is like being on different domains (ex our page is served from www.example-1.com and our api is
     hosted at www.domain-2.com/req/1)

     We are not using a proxy server and we are not thankfully not using JSONP. Instead we take advantage of a standard called
     CORS or CROSS-ORIGIN RESOURCE SHARING. This standard requires buy-in from the client and from the server
